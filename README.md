**Red Planet DNA: Diving into the World of Crypto Mining with NFT**

The world of cryptocurrencies and NFTs offers us new opportunities and tools for creativity. Red Planet DNA is a decentralized organization built on the concept of tokenizing real assets. At the heart of the project is mining hosting, which allows participants to mine Bitcoin together with the DAO.

**Red Planet NFT: The Key to a Galaxy of Opportunities**

*The Red Planet NFT collection consists of 5,000 artistic NFTs, which serve as a pass into the world of Red Planet DNA and give you access to unique opportunities and benefits:*

- **Bitcoin mining:** The liquidity from the sale of NFTs is directed toward mining equipment, allowing all NFT holders to mine Bitcoin together with the project.  
- **NFT holders can mine Bitcoin with the project** (when holding two or more NFTs in staking).  
- **Efficiency:** Red Planet DAO plans to expand its mining capacity by gradually adding more mining equipment, which increases the effectiveness of NFTs over time.  
- **Web3 activity:** Red Planet NFTs are the key to participating in various Web3 activities within the Red Planet DAO ecosystem, such as collaborations, drops, giveaways, and many other exciting events. Red Planet NFTs are a gateway to an active community with a unique atmosphere and opportunities for growth.

**Beyond utilitarianism:**

> *The Red Planet DNA team is a close-knit group of enthusiasts, each with deep expertise in their field and more than five years of experience in the crypto industry.*

Red Planet DNA aims to create an immersive universe that will draw you into its world:

- **Elaborate lore:** The Red Planet NFT collection features an intriguing lore, and the characters will be captured not only in NFTs but also in exciting video stories on the OmniFlix platform.  
- **Gameplay:** The project plans to develop a gaming branch that will add another level of interaction with Red Planet NFTs.  
- **Rarity and rune system:** The NFT collection includes a rarity system, while the rune system adds variety and flexibility to the use of the images.  
- **Live collection:** After the release of the main collection, Red Planet DAO will launch a limited edition of live utility NFTs on OmniFlix, which will have both collectible value and powerful utility.

> *The main characters of our collection are the space adventurer Purt and his loyal companion Lyra, featured in the NFT images below. You can dive deeper into their story in The Chronicles of the Red Planet, a series available on Red Planet DNA’s X (formally Twitter) page. The link will be provided at the end of the article.*

**We would also like to introduce you to technical explanation of the NFT Rune and Ranking System, skillfully crafted by our talented art creator [DarkninjaAM](https://t.me/DarkninjaAM):**

*This NFT collection introduces a multifaceted rarity and ranking system designed to enhance collectibility and value distribution. The system integrates a dual classification of runes, segmented rarity tiers, diverse character types, and individual NFT rankings. Here’s a detailed breakdown:*

**Runes Classification and Allocation**

**Classification:**

- The collection comprises 50 unique runes split evenly into Good Runes (25) and Evil Runes (25).

**Allocation:**

- Each rune is assigned to 100 NFTs, spread evenly across a total collection of 5,000 NFTs.  
- This means each NFT contains one rune, with exactly 100 NFTs sharing the same rune.

**Rune Ranking:**

- Each group of runes (Good and Evil) is ranked from 1 to 25.  
- Higher-ranked runes are linked with NFTs placed in higher value segments, enhancing the desirability of those NFTs.

**Individual NFT Ranking**

**Individual Ranking:**

- Every NFT in the collection is given a unique individual ranking between 1 and 5000.  
- This ranking reflects the rarity and potential value of an NFT based on its cumulative attributes (runes, segment, type).

**Correlation with Runes and Segments:**

- NFTs with lower individual ranking numbers (indicative of higher rarity) are more likely to feature higher-ranked runes and appear in more exclusive segments like Legend and Epic.

**Value Distribution Strategy**

**Segments:**

- The collection is divided into 4 rarity segments: Legend, Epic, Rare, and Common.  
- More limited and higher-ranking NFTs populate the Legend and Epic segments, adding exclusivity and value.

**Types:**

- Six types are available: Main character Purt, Supporting character Lyra (Pre-Cyborg and Cyborg forms), Purt and Lyra Combined, Moto Purt, and Moto Lyra.  
- Types have specific availability in different segments:  
  - **Purt and Lyra**: Available in all segments.  
  - **Moto Purt**: Exclusively in Legend and Epic.  
  - **Moto Lyra**: Available in Legend, Epic, and Rare.  
  - **Pre-Cyborg Lyra** and **Purt and Lyra Combined**: Only in Legend.

**Unique Rarity and Ranking Integration**

**Interaction of Runes and Individual Rankings:**

- High individual ranking numbers are typically associated with higher segment placement and higher rune ranks.  
- This interconnects various rarity indicators to ensure that even within lower segments, NFTs can have significant value if they have favorable rune or individual rankings.

**Strategic Rarity Design:**

- The integration of rune, individual ranking, segment, and type introduces a complex rarity structure.  
- It ensures value distribution is both logical and widespread, allowing each NFT mint the chance of having substantial perceived and actual value.

> *Since the collection uses abstract runes with no predetermined cultural or historical context, their meanings can be assigned based on general esoteric, alchemical or personal symbolism. Below is one possible interpretation for each of the 25 runes (from left to right, top to bottom).*
